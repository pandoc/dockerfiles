# Security Policy

We aim to keep the latest images up-to date and free of any potential
security problems. Please feel free to reach out if you have questions
or believe that you found a potential security issue.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email the maintainers,
albert+dockerfiles@zeitkraut.de and caleb@alerque.com.

## Limitations

The pandoc manual has a section entitled [A note on
security](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#a-note-on-security), which
describes some security guarantees pandoc does NOT make. Its also a good
resource for users of pandoc Docker images.

Also note that outside this repo, only the most recent version of pandoc
is supported with security updates. So while the other software in an
image may be patched to the latest level, issues in pandoc itself may
not have been fixed in older images.
